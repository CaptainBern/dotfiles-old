# Dotfiles

My dotfiles. Basically a copy of https://github.com/holman/dotfiles but with some
tweaks for me.

## Installation

(If you plan on installing i3 via the installation script, make sure you install xorg first if you haven't yet)

To install:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/CaptainBern/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
bootstrap/install.sh
```
